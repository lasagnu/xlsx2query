Since GITHUB does not store empty folders and uploads directory needs to exist I had to create this little abomination.

JavaScript was made for the masses,
It lacked types, and modules, and classes.
But it became quite the giant,
Because it ran on server and client,
Until it crashed both, despite 100 test passes.
